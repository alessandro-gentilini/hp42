# A Collection of 42s Calculator Programs

I'm an Emacs user, and it plays a significant role in my development
process.  For 42s code I use Emacs to generate code and process that
code for different versions of free42 (I use both free42 & a DM42).

All the code is contained in `org-mode` files in the `src` directory.

Binary free42 programs are in the `bin` directory.

Documentation (rendered `org-mode` files) may be found in the `docs` directory.

Have fun!
